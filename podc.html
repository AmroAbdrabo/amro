    <h1 style="font-size: 2.2em; font-family: Calibri;">Lecture 2: Coloring for General Graphs </h1>
    <p>
      <span class="first-letter">T</span>he set up is a network \(G=(V, E)\) and the task is to assign colors to nodes in \(V\) such that no two neighboring nodes have the same color. 
      We have \(\Delta  \equiv \) maximum degree in the graph. Ideally we want a \((\Delta + 1)\) coloring. 

      <h2>Linial's One-round Coloring</h2>
      <p>
        In one round, each neighbor can <i>only</i> know the identities of its neighbors. We show that Linial's algorithm can provide coloring using \(k' = O(\Delta^2 \log N)\) colors. First, 
        we introduce the concept of cover-free families. We call a collection \(f\) of sets \(S_1, S_2, S_3, ..., S_N \subseteq \{1, ..., k'\}\) a \(\Delta-\)cover free family if and only if for any indices
        \(i_0, i_1, ...,i_{\Delta} \in \{1, ..., N\}\) then \(S_{i_0} \not\subseteq \cup_{j=1}^{\Delta} S_{i_j} \). Intuitively, this means that each set has something that none of the other "neighboring" sets has. Notice that given an algorithm to find these sets, then 
        whatever the graph topology is we can construct the coloring for that graph, provided of course the number of sets is the same as the vertex count of the graph. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Claim:</b> There exists sets \(S_1, ..., S_N \subseteq {1, ..., k'} \) for \(k' = O(\Delta^2 \log N)\) that form a \(\Delta-\)cover free family. This implies a single-round coloring algorithm with \(O(\Delta^2 \log N)\) colors.

      <p>
        We provide a probabilistic proof:
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Proof:</b>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We want to build sets \(S_1, ..., S_N \subseteq \{1, ..., k'\} \) with \(k' = O(\Delta^2 \log N)\) that form a \(\Delta\)-cover free family.
          </li>
          <li>
            We build \(S_1, ..., S_N\) randomly and show that they satisfy the desired property with positive probability so they must exist. 
          </li>
          <li>
            For each set \(S_i\), include each element \(\{ 1, ..., k' \}\) in it randomly with probability \(\frac{1}{\Delta}\), and independently.  
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        
      </p>

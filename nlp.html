    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>
     Assume you are the manager of a customer service center. You are working for a company that sells hats and shirts, and you want to 
     get an idea of how people are feeling about your hats and shirts overall. Let's say you get a 1000 calls, and you might have your customer 
     care representatives take notes on people's satisfaction with their purchases. Another technique you can do, is to apply NLP to figure out 
     if there is positive emotion or not from their feedback. Applying this technique on the record of calls, you can for example see that 
     people are happy about the hats but not the shirts. The methods used to achieve this are called <i> sentiment analysis</i>.     
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example is you working for a legal firm. You are working on a case where someone at a compnay may have embezzled some money. The company gives you 
        access to the emails, and you only want to go through the emails which are likely related to embezzling money. Thus, after running your NLP algorithm, 
        you assign one or more labels to each email, and prioritize emails which have a <b>Money</b> label and not other label such as <b>Personal</b>. This NLP technique 
        is called <i>topic modelling</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a last example, assume you're a writer for an inspirational quote company. You're task is to write a quote every day of the year. But then after 11 months, you
        run out of ideas. You have a lot of quotes and as a Python developer, you think why not use python to generate a new quote for me. This is called <i>text generation</i>.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Let's quickly recap the topics:
        <ul>
            <li>Sentiment analysis </li>
            <li>
                Topic modelling 
            </li>
            <li>
                Text generation
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
     
    <h1>Data Science Workflow</h1>
    <p>
        The typical data scientific workflow typically flows the pattern:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with a question: If I study more, will I get a higher grade?</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Get and clean the data: missing values, badly formatted values, incorrect type
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Exploratory data analysis: plots, correlation coefficients, sample statistics, outliers (get a "feeling" for the data)
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Apply techniques: linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, and other ML techniques. Example output, grade = 1.5*study hours + 65
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
                Share insights: Yes, there is a positive correlation. However, since there was a smarty pant student who had a high grade with little study time, the result of linear regression is over-optimistic. 
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h1>
        Case study 
    </h1>
 <p>
    The case study we investigate here is Ali Wong's comedy routine. 
 </p>

 <h2>
    Question
 </h2>
 <p>
    What makes Ali Wong's comedy routine different. 
 </p>

 <h2>
    Gather data
 </h2>
 <p>
    Transcripts of stand-up shows were obtained from the website <i>Scraps from the loft</i> and the list of 9 other comedians 
    was obtained using an advanced search on IMDB using the following filters:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stand-up comedy specials from the last 5 years
        </li>
        <li>
            At least 7.5 rating on IMDB with 2000+ votes
        </li>
    </ul>
 </p>
 <h2>
    Clean data
 </h2>

  <p>
 The data should like this
 <figure style="margin-top: -10px;">
    <img src="img/comedian_data.PNG" alt="" style = "width: 110%; height: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">  

    <figcaption>Fig. 1 -Data in corpus format</figcaption>
  </figure>
 
</p>
  <p>
    The next step is to format the data. There are two formats: Corpus and Document-Term matrix
  </p>
  <p>
    The corpus (collection of texts) format is very simple: it is shown in Fig. 1 above. The second format, document-term matrix, is a matrix where each row corresponds to a document and the columns corresponds to words. Each cell denotes the count of that word (column) for that document (row).

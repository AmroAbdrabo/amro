    <h1>Exam 2020</h1>
    <div class="question"> <h2>Question 1: Linear regression</h2> 1. Let \(\mathbf{X}\) be a centered \(n \times d\)  matrix whose rows are the input vectors \(\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\)
    of a training set \(\mathcal{D} = \{ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) | i=1, ...,n  \} \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R} \), and let \( \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^n = (y_1,..., y_n) \)

    <ul>
        <li>
            If a closed form linear regression solution \( \overset{\wedge}{f} (\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T (\mathbf{(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty} ) \) exists then \( \overset{\wedge}{f}(\mathbf{x}) \) is the projection of \(x\) onto a hyperplane that intersects the origin 
            <br> <br>
            <b>Answer</b>: True since this is the least squares solution of the regression problem from homework 1 which consists of finding a projection plane that minimizes the residual sum of squares error. There is no bias term and thus the plane passes by the origin. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Linear ridge regression does not have a closed form solution if \(n < d\)
            <br> <br>
            <b>Answer</b>: False. Linear ridge regression either has no solution or a unique solution from the expression for the parameters \( \overset{\wedge}{\beta} = (\mathbf{X^TX} + \lambda \mathbb{I})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y} \) so the unique solution depends on the invertibility of \( \mathbf{X^TX} + \lambda \mathbb{I} \). See the StatQuest video on ridge for more info. Note that in the case of normal linear regression, when \( 
                n < d\) then \( rank(\mathbf{X}) = \min(n, d) = n\) and so \( rank(X^TX) \leq \min(rank(X), rank(X^T))= rank(X) \) since \(rank(X^T) = rank(X)\) therefore since \(rank(X^TX) \neq d\) we have that \(X^TX\) is not invertible.  
        </li>

    </ul>

    2. Consider now the regularized least squares optimization problem given by \[  \overset{\wedge}{\beta}=\text{arg min}_{\beta} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i  - \sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{i,j}\beta_j  )^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{d}|\beta_j|^q \right\} \] 
    <ul>
        <li>
            This optimization problem is convex for every \(q>0\)
            <br><br>

        <b>Answer</b>: False. Let \(q < 1\); for example, \(q= \frac{1}{2}\) then clearly the function \(\sum_{j=1}^{d}\sqrt{|\beta_j|}  \) is not convex since the square root function for single variable is not convex and for multivariable we fix all variables except one variable to see that the curved traced
         by the intersection of the (hyper)plane with the function is not convex. The more we increase \(\lambda\) the clearer will be the non-convexity of the function. Constrain all the variables to the (hyper)sphere \( \sum_i \beta_i^2 < 1 \) then clearly \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i  - \sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{i,j}\beta_j  )^2  \) is bounded in this (hyper)spherical region. Even if we were to 
         assume that in this region the function (given by the sum of the regularizer and residual squares) is convex then we can increase \( \lambda\) enough to make it non-convex within this region. 
        </li>
        <li>
            
            This optimization problem is equivalent to minimizing the unregularized least squares error \( \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \sum_{j=1}^d x_{i, j}\beta_j )^2 \) subject to the constraint \( \sum_{j=1}^d |\beta_j|^2 \leq \mu \) for an appropriate value of the paramter \(\mu\) <br> <br>
            <b>Answer:</b> True. Lecture 8 on Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd on YouTube goes into detail as to how the dual of this constrained optimization problem, with \(\mu = 0 \), is equivalent to solving the unconstrained problem. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="question"> <h2>Question 2: LASSO regression as MAP regression</h2> 
    Consider a data set \(\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) | i=1,...n \}  \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\). Assume that the distribution from which \(\mathcal{D}\) is sampled has the property that for every \(\mathbf{x} \in  \mathbb{R}^d\), the conditional distribution of the target is Gaussian, i.e. 
    \[  Y | (X = \mathbf{x}, \beta ) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}^T \beta, \sigma^2) \] 
    for some known fixed \(\sigma > 0\). Here \(Y\) and \(X\) denote the random variables of which the \(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\) are realizations. Recall that performing LASSO regression means solving the optimization problem 
    \[\overset{\wedge}{\beta} =  \text{arg min}_{\beta} \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \beta^T \mathbf{x_i})^2  +\lambda \sum_{j=1}^d|\beta_j|  \right\} \] 

    In this problem, the goal is to show that LASSO regression is equivalent to finding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate in the Bayesian setting in which we assume that the weights \(\beta_j\)have i.i.d Laplacian prior distributions: 
    \[ p(\beta_j) = \frac{1}{2b} \exp{  (-\frac{|\beta_j|}{b}) } \text{ for all } j \in \{1, .., d\}\] 

    <b>Hint</b>: for simplicity, you may assume that the data set \(\mathcal{D}\) is centered in the following

    <br><br>
    1. Write down the natural logarithm of the <i>un-normalized</i> posterior distribution of \(\beta\). Do not stop at a symbolic formulation, but actually plug in the explicit probability density functions for the data points. "Un-normalized" means you do not have to worry about the evidence but only compute a term that is proportional to the posterior. 
    <br> <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> from Bishop page 30 (Bayes' rule), we have that the posterior is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior. Therefore, we get that \[
    \log{p(\beta| \mathcal{D})   } \approx \log( p(\mathbf{\beta})p(\mathcal{D}| \beta)  ) = \log \left( \prod_{j=1}^d p(\beta_j) \prod_{n=1}^N \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x_n}^T \beta,\sigma^2 ) \right)

    \]

    \[ =\sum_{j=1}^d \log p(\beta_j)  + \sum_{n=1}^N \log \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x_n}^T\beta, \sigma^2) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=1}^N (y_n - \mathbf{x_n}^T\beta)^2 - \frac{1}{b}\sum_{j=1}^d |\beta_j| + const\] 

    <br> <br>
    2. Show that maximization with respect to \(\beta \) of the term we derived in a) for a given value of \(b\) is equivalent to minimization of the LASSO objective in equation (1) for a value \( \lambda \equiv \lambda(b) \). Derive the formula describing how \(\lambda(b)\) depends on \(b\). 
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Maximizing the negative of a function is equivalent to minimizing the function. Therefore, we see that \(\lambda = -\frac{1}{b}\).
    
    </div>

    <div class="question"><h2>Question 3: Bootstrapping </h2>
    Recall that the na√Øve Bootstrapping estimate of the error of a classifier is defined as \[ \widehat{Err}_{boot} = \frac{1}{B}\frac{1}{N} \sum_{b=1}^B \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \overset{\wedge *b}{c}(x_i))  \]
    where \(B\) is the number of training sets (each of the same size \(N\) as the original data set), and \(  \overset{\wedge *b}{c}(x_i) \) is the value at \(x_i\) prediced by the model fitted to the \(b\)th bootstrap set. 
    Here \(L\) is the 0/1 Loss, i.e. \(L(y, c(x)) = 1_{c(x)\neq y}\).
    <br> <br>
    Consider now a 1-nearest neighbor classifier applied to a two-class classification problem with the same number of observations in each class, in which the features and class labels are <i>independent</i>.
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Compute the true error rate of the 1-nearest neighbor classifier. <br> <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> Since the label is independent of the features the Bayes error rate is 50% (coin flip). By definition, the Bayes classifier minimizes the probability of misclassification and thus any other classifier will achieve 50% asymptotic error.  It cannot achieve a smaller error probability than 50% since it is bound below by Bayes classifier and also it cannot 
    attain a higher error probability than 50% since simply computing its negation will give us an error probability less than 50%. 

    <br> <br>
    2.  Give an expression in terms of \(N\) for the error estimated by \(\widehat{Err}_{boot}\) as \( N \rightarrow \infty \). <br>
    <b>Hint</b>: for a data point \(x_i\), compute the probability that \(x_i\) is contained in a given bootstrap data set. 

    <br> <br>
    <b>Answer:</b> The probability that \(x_i\) is not sampled in a given bootstrap is \(\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^N = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{N} \right)^N \) which as \(N \rightarrow \infty\) tends to \(\frac{1}{e} \approx \frac{1}{3}\). The probability it is not contained in any of the bootstrap sets is thus 
    \(\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^B \). The probability of misclassification is thus \(p(c(x_i) \neq y_i) = p(x_i \text{ not picked })p(\text{nearest neighbor is different}) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^B \frac{1}{2} \) which is clearly less than 0.5 mentioned earlier. 
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Give a reason why \(\widehat{Err}_{boot} \) does not provide a good estimate for the true prediction error. 
    <br> <br>
    <b>Answer</b>: since the error rate is less than the Bayes classifier, we arrive at a contradiction. The "error" was computed to be this low because we introduced a correlation between test and train data as we let \(N\) approach infinity.

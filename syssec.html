    <h2>Lecture 11: IoT Security</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="first-letter">A</span>n example of a naive IoT protocol is that implemented by the ZigBee Light Link,
      where a network switch enrypts a network key using a master ZLL key and sends the encrypted key to the light bulb for further communication using the encryption network key. For example, the 
      switch can then send \( E_{network\ key}[On\ command] \) to switch on the bulb. The problem is that anyone can desolder the processor of the bulb and extract the master key shared by all light bulbs. The attacker who has this key can then change the network key, force a light bulb to blink for 18 hours, or factory reset. 
      The attacker need not be in proximity of the victim bulb to perform this attack since an antenna suffices to attain the desired signal strength. 
    </p>

    <p>
        ZigBee enables over-the-air updates which should be verified using asymmetric crypto, thereby having a different public key for each bulb. However, it was noticed that when the bulbs sent a request for updates from Philips servers, the servers responded with the same 
        message (called firmware1.img on the slides) for the same update version of course. Thus, the servers encrypted the message with same global public key that was assigned to all bulbs. Asymmetric cyptography was clearly not used. Since the public encryption key is now known the last step is 
        to extract the signing key for the firmware update. To extract this, we note that the <strong>private signing key is symmetric and stored on the device</strong> since asymmetric cryptography was not used. Applying different power analysis on the gateway's private signing key allows uncovering the key and hence sending
        any update to the bulbs.  
    </p>

        IoT devices are prone to worms since they are vulnerable, have a radio, and can be infected via radio commands. Thus, IoT devices can infect other devices. To find how many devices are needed to infect all devices in a range is given by <b>percolation theory</b>. Assuming all the devices are uniformly randomly distributed  in an area <i>A</i> and that the 
        radius of operation of each device is <i>R</i> then the number of <b>initially-infected</b> devices needed to spread to all other devices is: \[ N = 1.128 \frac{A}{\pi R^2}\]
        Possible attacks include hardware bricking (physically destroying the hardware), 2.4 GHz jamming (other devices can no longer communicate in this frequency band), and triggering epileptic seizures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Myth</b>: short range communication means no adversary can eavesdrop the communication if she is not nearby. With the appropriate antenna and amplifier, wireless signals can be eavesdropped or injected from large distances (more than a kilometer). 
    </p>

    <p>
        The IETF has tried to standardize IoT by creating a potential IoT protocol stack that is <b>interoperable</b> (unified for all devices) and <b>lightweight</b>: <img src="img/iotlayers.png" alt="" style = "width: 50%; height: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">
       <br> In reality however, IoT devices such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WiFi, LoRa, all have different IoT stacks. Many IoT devices such as ZigBee use a <b>sort of</b> standardized stack such as <br> <img src="img/iotlay.png" alt="" style = "width: 30%; height: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"> 
       <br>where green indicates that a feature has security options. As many small devices are low power, it is uncertain whether they will ever be able to use the full IP protocol stack, hence the need for these IoT stacks. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Encryption is not enough since for ZigBee, BLE, and WiFi the MAC address is in cleartext and events (such as switching on a IoT device) are marked by sharp rise in bitrate (B/s). For example, an attacker can infer a user's home activity from encrypted traffic by monitoring device MAC addresses as well as traffic volume: <br>  
        <img src="img/events.png" alt="" style = "width: 50%; height: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"> <br>
        This attack involves machine learning to derive the device state, and thus derive the user behavior.

      Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately realized
      that I needed to follow in the footsteps of the masters. So I started dissecting the rules that
      makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.
    </p>
    <p>There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged pains</strong>...</p>
    <blockquote>Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours ü¶ã</blockquote>
    <h2>An unexpected journey</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="first-letter">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your style.
      Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with <code>line-height</code> to get it right.
    </p>
    <h2>The hero</h2>
    <p>We all know who the leader is.<br/>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three sectors: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.<br/>Specifically I found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that <strong>Medium</strong> uses are respectively <span class="highlighted">Lora</span>,
      <span class="highlighted">Montserrat</span> and <span class="highlighted">Playfair Display</span>.<br/>I discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for <code>blockquote</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Content font</h2>
    <p>
       The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with
      the lowest amount of effort.<br/><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your
      font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).
      While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compacts.
    </p>
    <h2>Brand font</h2>
    <p>
       The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
      We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.
    </p>
    <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example ü§´</blockquote>
    <h2>UI font</h2>
    <p>
       The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.
      Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content.<br/>It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page
      but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class="highlighted">Reading!</span><br/>You can use it also for <code>h2</code> making the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one used for the main title.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="highlighted">The highlight</span></h2>
    <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span class="highlighted">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>
    <h1>Every Title</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">`Needs a subtitle`</p>
    <p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>
    <h2>The length</h2>
    <p class="lineLength">
       The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page.</p>
    <h2>The color</h2>
    <p>
       The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to ensure the best contrast possible.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br/>But, if you are in trouble...</p>
    <blockquote>Use Medium.css ‚úçÔ∏è</blockquote><br/><br/>
